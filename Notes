in orther to make the virtual work we need a pointer called vPointer

without the virtual keyword
sizeof(base) = 4.
sizeof(derived) = 8;//because it inherits the base variable

With the virtual keyword
sizeof(base) = 8.// Tells the program that a function inherits from it and acts accordingly
sizeof(derived) = 12;// Why it is 12 I have no idea.

The size of Derived is the size of Base (8) plus the size of Derived (4), which is 12.

The Vtable is what make the Polymorphisme work 

Virtual : turn on the vTable so we can easily see or understand witch function to be executed

                ****    there is a difference between RunTime and CompileTime of course ***

-------> at compile time the Compiler understand witch function to witch caller ....

when we do make something virtual that's when we get the Polymorphisme


Key Points:

---> there always a Vtable for every Type and not every instance of a type !!!! But when there is a Virtual inside it of course
---> Virtual Table only stores addresses of virtual function

Pure virtual Function : 
it has nothing to do so better we add a flag to it = 0 to tell the parser (Part of the compiler) that it will serve
as only a virtual and it will be overriden by the derived classes...

any class that has a Pure Virtual Function will never be called a class but it's name will change and becomes : 
-->     An abstract class
when becomes abstract we can't instantiate objects but only pointers... (Very important !!)

Recap !!
--> Why we need Polymorphisme and when ?

Method = function inside a class

Polymorphisme : the capability of an object to act in many differente ways 
this happens through two concepts witch are :
**** Function overloading ...                           ***Function Overriding ....
same func with differente parameters                 a child class has the same func name as it's base class
                                                     but the behaviour or the definition of it is differente

SINGLE ACTION IN A differente WAYS = Polymorphisme.

Abstraction : mean hiding all the details and showing only the important stuff from the User
example:
        -> The Coffee Machine u only need to know the selection and the payment.
           without any need to know that the water hot degree or the quantity of the milk in it or anything !! (This Called Abstract Idea)
        -> Like ANY Other Object in Real life (Car - Phone - Lap...)
****> In Programming the Users shoud have an Abstract access to our program 
so they do not need to know how the classes are handing details or how it works they only need to have an abstract idea
they only need to know what to make based on this class...
Very Important in Big Projects... (The Programmer for example need to worry only about it's Task)

to Make this Happen We Need to differeciate between:

                        ***INTERFACE  &&  IMPLEMENTATION***
the thing that gives the opportunity to classes to communicate between each Other
like getting some infos about a class so we can use it inside the current class
-> for example if your coding a FooClass inside a chess board and u need to see if the king is in echec
u only need an INTERFACE to give u the idea like this isKinginEchec() if true u do the code if not u do ur logic 
so u don't need to know how it works or it's logic.
-> The idea is to make it Independent and have no idea what going on on the other side so we can do our changes to the 
other classes without any limitations..

                *** Pure Virtual Functio ****
        by not haviing a Pure Virtual func we still have the option to not override it 
        but once we have a Pure One it is required to be overriden and the class becomes
        an Abstract Class

--> In OOp some times we create a class that only contains a bunch of Virtual Functions this way it acts as 
    a Template Class for our derived classes and force them to ovveride him... THIS IS WHAT REFERS TO AS AN INTERFACE

so INTERFACE = a class that has functions without implementation.

Ex03 _ Polymorphisme
-------------------------

In the context of the exercise you provided earlier, the term "RPG game" stands for "Role-Playing Game." 
RPG games are a genre of video games where players assume the roles of characters and immerse themselves in
a fictional world. Players typically control a single character or a group of characters, known as a party, 
and engage in various adventures, quests, and battles.

In the exercise, the RPG game is not an actual game that you play on a gaming console or computer. Instead, 
it serves as a conceptual context for implementing various classes and their interactions. The exercise simulates 
the mechanics of an RPG game by introducing abstract classes (AMateria, ICharacter) and concrete classes (Ice, Cure, 
Character, MateriaSource) that represent different aspects of the game, such as characters, abilities, and skills.

The exercise's purpose is to teach and reinforce object-oriented programming concepts in C++, including inheritance, 
polymorphism, interfaces, and dynamic memory management. By implementing these classes, you will learn how to model 
and interact with different components of an RPG game in a structured and object-oriented manner.

Remember, the RPG game in this exercise is just a conceptual backdrop to practice and understand the principles 
of object-oriented programming. It's a fun and engaging way to learn about classes, inheritance, and interfaces 
in the context of a fictional game world.

the purpose of the Abstract class is to provide the base class form wich will be inherited by other classes 
in the hierarchy
